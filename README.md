# Parent's Allowance Calculator
A calculator generating your monthly parental allowance

![Am I responsive](/readme_content/am_I_responsive.png)

## About

In Sweden, amongst other countries, a parental allowance is calculated based on your annual salary. 

**Background**
As a soon-to-be parent you may wonder how to financially structure your time on leave, in order to take care of your newborn. 
Sweden offers 420 days to be equally split between the parents but the allowance is based on each individual's income. When you plan your maternity or paternity leave you may want to know how much your on-leave income will be.

The allowance is in this app calculated on the Swedish structure where you get 80% of your annual gross salary, with 30% tax deducted on top of that.
This leaves you with your annual allowance.

Depending on how many days a month you want to take out, the calculations will give you your decided monthly allowance.

## User Experience

### User Stories
* As a user I want to:
    * Find out about my total yearly allowance when going on maternity-/paternity leave
    * Find out how much I could get each month in order to plan my finances

## Features

## Input data

Input data features in terms of:
1. Input yearly gross salary
2. Input days per month to be on-leave
3. Input month to base calculations on

### Calculations

* calculate_annual_allowance fucntion is calculating the total yearly allowance 
* calculate_monthly_allowance function is calculating the requested monthly allowance

### Features to be implemented
Connect an API in form of Google Sheets which:
* Collects the users data for the business owner
* Analyse the users data for statistics

## Technologies Used

### Languages
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Frameworks, Deployment, Libraries
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

## Testing

### Functionality
* I used the deployed site to manually entering correct and incorrect data to see how my program responded. 
* I used the bug feature with breakpoints in Gitpod
* Frequently add print() in my functions to follow my code and values behaviour 

### Validator Testing
* I ran through my file in [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/). No errors occured.

## Issues found during development

I had issues with the while loop in get_income_data function and the data then being sent to validation_function, however I did not manage to get the return value be passed on to the calculation function in the very end of the program. 

![get_data and validating_data function](/readme_content/validate_data function.png)

I at first solved this with a controversal function called ![Walrus Operator](https://realpython.com/python-walrus-operator/) which in short assigns a value to a variable and then returns that value. However this code was not passed the validation test in PEP8, so I wanted to re-write it.

I went through the Love Sandwiches codes, went back several times to the While Loop / Try-Except and If statements on CI,asked in Slack and researched online. 
I tried to troubleshoot to see where the value gone missing:
![None_value](/readme_content/none_value.png)

and finally I came to the conclusion to merge the two functions and write everything in get_data_function. Perhaps one would say that was a short-cut but I managed to solve the problem before anyone in Slack had responded. 




## Deployment

I followed below steps when deploying my project to Heroku, based on Code Institute instructions:

1. Remove un-needed import features in run.py file
2. Add to requirements.txt file:
    - pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    - Commit changes to Github:
    - git commit -m "Add requirements for deployment‚Äù

In HEROKU after creating account:
1. "Create new App"
2. Give the App a unique name and enter region
3. Click on "Create App"
4. Click on "Settings" on your new App Dashboard
5. Scroll down to Config Vars where in my instance I only inserted KEY: PORT and VALUE: 8000 since I have no creds.json files to add.
6. Press Add-button
7. Scroll down to Buildpacks and press the icon for Python, click Save Changes, then press the icon for Nodejs and save changes. These Buildpacks need to be in below order:
    - Python
	- NodeJS
8. Go to Deploy section tab and scroll down to Deployment Method. I connected to my Github pages and could thereafter search for my Github Repository "Parents Allowance Calculator" and then click connect. 
9. Scroll down to Automatic and Manual Deploys sections. I clicked on Automatic Deployment so that my changes that I push to github automatically updates in Heroku. 
10. Then in the Manual Deploy section, press Deploy Branch
11. After project has been deployed successfully I clicked the View-button to see the program run in the terminal.
