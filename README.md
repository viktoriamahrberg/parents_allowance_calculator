# Parent's Allowance Calculator

## About

In Sweden, amongst other countries, a parental allowance is calculated based on your annual salary. 
**Background**
As a soon-to-be parent you may wonder how to financially structure your time on leave, in order to take care of your newborn. 
Sweden offers 420 days to be equally split between the parents but the allowance is based on each individual's income. When you plan your maternity or paternity leave you may want to know how much your on-leave income will be.

The allowance is in this app calculated on the Swedish structure where you get 80% of your annual gross salary, with 30% tax deducted on top of that.
This leaves you with your annual allowance.

Depending on how many days a month you want to take out, the calculations will give you your decided monthly allowance.
